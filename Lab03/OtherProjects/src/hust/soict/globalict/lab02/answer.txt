No, Java does not allow you to create two constructors with the same number 
and type of parameters. 
Since both constructors youâ€™re suggesting take a single String parameter, 
Java would not be able to differentiate between the two. 
This is because constructors are differentiated by the number and types of their parameters, 
not by the parameter names or intended use.
